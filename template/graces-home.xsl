			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p><a href="http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Tales_of_Graces" rel="external">Tales of Graces</a> is a character-driven Action-RPG and the 12th Mothership Title in Namco's Tales series. It was released in 2009 for the Wii and got a big upgrade for its 2010 PlayStation 3 release.</p>
			<p>We consider it just about the best Tales game battle-system wise, yet just about the worst Tales game plot and character design wise.</p>
			<p>The only page here so far is <a href="MagicCarta/">a checklist for collecting Magic Carta</a>, and Daniel only created that one because he wasn't happy with the print version of Aselia's Magic Carta list.</p>
			<p>Still, maybe someone'll find it useful. -/o/</p>
