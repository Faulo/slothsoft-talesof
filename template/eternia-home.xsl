			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p><a href="http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Tales_of_Eternia" rel="external">Tales of Eternia</a> is a character-driven Action-RPG and the 3rd Mothership Title in Namco's Tales series. It was released in 2000 for the PlayStation and again 2005 for the PlayStation Portable.</p>
			<p>It is one of our favorite Tales games, which is why we tried to create a <a href="CraymelEditor/">useful tool</a> here for better Greater Craymel management.</p>
			<p>The <a href="MelnicsTest/">Melnics Test</a> was just a byproduct of the <a href="/Japanese/KanaTest/">Kana Learning Program</a> and is probably not very helpful. :'D</p>
			<p>The latest addition is the <a href="MelnicsTranslator/">Melnics Translator</a>, which might even be charitably described as "somewhat useful"...! :O</p>
			<p>If you haven't checked out Tales of Eternia yet, you definitely should. -/o/</p>
